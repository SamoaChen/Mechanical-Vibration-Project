# Mechanical-Vibration-Project
## This repo include a simulation of mechanical vibration during transportation of cardboard boxes, to be specific a three boxes system
* Derived equations of montion in matrix form using lagrangian method with damping included
* Simulated frequency response of the system and provided recommendation for minimizing vibration amplitude
**Optimized Time Domain Response (driven frequency under normal truck speed):**
